Lab1:
The program simulates a simple shell which prompts the user for commands and create a child process to execute them, then the outputs are printed to the terminal as long as the user does not enter CTRL-C or "exit".

To compile and run, use commands: gcc lab1.c and ./a.out

Lab2:
The program will execute a command given through the command line interface.
Compared to the previous program, it is able to process symbols like > and |. Since the program will only run once per command, the & symbol is trivial and therefore will not be processed.
To compile and run, use commands gcc lab1.c and ./a.out command.
